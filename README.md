**meanr** is an R package performing basic sentiment analysis.  Its main main method, `score()`, computes sentiment as a simple average.  More sophisticated techniques are available to R, for example in the **qdap** package's `polarity()` function.  The package uses [the Hu and Liu sentiment dictionary](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html), same as everybody else.

**meanr** is significantly faster than everything else I tried (which was actually the motivation for its creation), but I don't claim to have tried everything.  There are also many opportunities for optimization in this implementation, but so far it's fast enough for my purposes that I'm not yet interested.



## Installation

<!-- You can install the stable version from CRAN using the usual `install.packages()`:

```r
install.packages("meanr")
``` -->

The development version is maintained on GitHub, and can easily be installed by any of the packages that offer installations from GitHub:

```r
### Pick your preference
devtools::install_github("wrathematics/meanr")
ghit::install_github("wrathematics/meanr")
remotes::install_github("wrathematics/meanr")
```



## Example Usage

I have a dataset that, for legal reasons, I can not describe, much less provide.  You can think of it like a collection of tweets (they are not tweets).  But take my word for it that it's real, English language text.  The data is in the form of a vector of strings, which we'll call `x`.

```r
x = readRDS("x.rds")

length(x)
## [1] 655760

sum(nchar(x))
## [1] 162663972

library(meanr)
system.time(s <- score(x))
##  user  system elapsed 
## 1.100   0.008   1.117 

head(s)
##   positive negative        avg  wc
## 1        2        0 0.06250000  32
## 2        5        0 0.17241379  29
## 3        4        2 0.02985075  67
## 4       12        3 0.04433498 203
## 5        8        2 0.06000000 100
## 6        4        3 0.01020408  98
```



## How It Works

The `score()` function receives a vector of strings, and operates on each one as follows:

1. The string is copied to a buffer.
2. All punctuation is removed. All characters are converted to lowercase.
3. Score sentiment:
    - Tokenize words as collections of chars separated by a space.
    - Look up each word in a hash table of Hu and Liu's dictionary.
    - If the word is in the table, get its value from the hash table (positive words have value 1, negative words -1) and update the various counts.  Otherwise, the word is "neutral" (score of 0).

The hash table uses a perfect hash function generated by gperf.
